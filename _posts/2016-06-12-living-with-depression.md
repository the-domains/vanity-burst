  Depression is a mental illness that causes people to lose pleasure from daily
  life. It can complicate other medical conditions and can even be serious
  enough to lead to suicide. Many factors can contribute to depression,
  including: biochemical imbalances in the brain, family history, difficult life
  events (such as divorce or the death of a loved one), side effects from
  medication, and negative thought patterns. Although there are many forms of
  depression, the two most common are major depressive disorder and dysthymia (a
  milder longer-lasting form of depression).

# Living with DEPRESSION

Depression is a mental illness that causes people to lose pleasure from daily life. It can complicate other medical conditions and can even be serious enough to lead to suicide. Many factors can contribute to depression, including: biochemical imbalances in the brain, family history, difficult life events (such as divorce or the death of a loved one), side effects from medication, and negative thought patterns. Although there are many forms of depression, the two most common are major depressive disorder and dysthymia (a milder longer-lasting form of depression). 

WHO GETS DEPRESSION?

Depression can occur in anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. Research indicates that as many as one in eight teens and 19 million adults suffer from clinical depression. Unfortunately, many people with depression resist treatment because they think that they can treat it themselves or that it is a personal weakness rather than a serious medical illness. 

SYMPTOMS

Everyone should know the warning signs of depression and be ready to take action. The following symptoms may indicate depression, particularly if they last for two or more weeks: • Withdrawal from friends, family, and other social activities • Sadness and hopelessness • Lack of enthusiasm, energy, or motivation • Anger and rage • Overreaction to criticism • Feelings of being unable to meet expectations • Poor self-esteem or guilt • Indecision, lack of concentration, or forgetfulness • Restlessness and agitation • Drug and alcohol abuse • Changes in eating or sleeping patterns • Thoughts of suicide or death

TREATMENT

No single treatment approach works for everyone. A combination of medication, professional help, and support from family, friends, and peers help individuals with depression stabilize their emotions and behavior. Early detection and treatment can help one alleviate his or her symptoms.

If you or someone you know is in crisis now, seek help immediately. Call United Way crisis center 211\. Or dial 911 for immediate assistance.
